# Relational-Database-and-Visualization-Dashboard

The goal of this project is to design and create a relational database for a local business that will allow the owner to capture and store all the important information and data that the business generates. This will allow us to also create dashboards that help us monitor business performance. The business is a local pizza place called Lex's Pizza and we will be working with the data from their opening month. The owner requiers us to concentrate in 3 main areas:
* Customer Orders
* Stock Levels
* Staff

MySQL was used for the creation of the Database and PowerBi was used for the creation of the Dashboards.
